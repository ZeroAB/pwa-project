            <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
            <p>Existing budgeting apps are often designed for working professionals, loaded with complex features like bank linking, investment tracking, and advanced planning tools that are irrelevant and overwhelming for college students.</p>
            <p>Students need a tool that's quick, simple, and focuses on the basics: How much did I get? How much did I spend? What's left?</p>
